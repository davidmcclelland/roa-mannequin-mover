# Relics of Avabur Mannequin Mover
Moves Ava's mannequin quick-select to the main page for easier access

## Installation
* Install TamperMonkey ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)), ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/))
  * GreaseMonkey on FireFox is not recommended, but feel free to test it.
* After installing TamperMonkey, install [RoA Mannequin Mover](https://github.com/davidmcclelland/roa-mannequin-mover/raw/master/roa-mannequin-mover.user.js)
* Refresh Avabur

## Warnings
This script is very simple and not very smart. Since Ava doesn't load your possible loadouts until you go to the `Inventory` page, the dropdown will appear empty until you open the page by hand.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to @dang on Ava for finding the html IDs that needed moved
